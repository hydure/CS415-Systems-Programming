## CS415-Systems-Programming
CS415 W&amp;M Projects for the Spring 2017 Semester

### Project 1: beetle.c
A warm-up program.

### Project 2: rgpp.c
A second warm-up program.

### Project 3: report.d
Learned how to code parallel piping procedures through 5 separate programs

### Project 4: ttt.d
Learned how to create a basic server through datagram and data stream conenctions via ports, as well as mutliple clients that all can interact with the server through either its datagram or data stream ports at the same time in order to have a successful two-player game of tic-tac-toe going one at a time with further clients being queued up and others able to request the current game status...very challenging.

### Project 5: counter.c
Learning how to multithread with mutexes and locks.

### Project 6: boiler
Learning how to create and run basic scripts in awk/gawk on the program beetle.c.

### Project 7: P7
Creating yet another clients-server tic-tac-toe game to corresponding and constantly update a tic-tac-toe GUI that I had to make using tcl and piping to it from the executable file.
